A [Steganography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography) tool to hide data inside of an image.

## What does this do?
This tool allows you to save text data inside of an image. The image itself will look almost unchanged. Picking an image with a lot of noise will make the changes even less visible.

## Tutorial

### Encoding
Choose an image you want to use as the medium for your secret. Write your data into the text box on the right side, and hit __Encode__ when finished. After encoding you can save the image by hitting __Save Image__.

### Decoding
To decode an existing image, switch to the __Decode__ tab on the top and load the image. Pressing the __Decode__ will extract any data from the image.

> Note that it is possible to make the small changes visible by increasing the contrast of the image with an image processing tool.
